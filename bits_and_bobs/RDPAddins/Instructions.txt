In some enviroments Copy and Paste via RDP is disabled to potentially work around this
Install RDPAddins on your Windows Machine, then from Kali/Linux use RedSnarf with the 
file transcribe option to upload the FileTransfer.exe Binary.

This should take approx 30 mins.

Once the file has been typed out, save then from a command prompt
certutil -decode filename.b64 filename.exe

The way this works is RedSnarf encodes the file to base64 then simulates user input to 
type it out to the remote machine which then allow you to decode, run the file and transfer
files back and forth.
